* Of course, this couldn't have been done without [SOX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) and all those who contribute to it.

ROADMAP
---------
* Add more french / english podcasts
* Add new languages: German, Japanese, Chinese, Russian... Do you want any podcast to be added? Please [contact me](http://twitter.com/ojoven)
* Handle the versions via DB, instead of having them hardcoded
* Handle the errors when retrieving and treating the mp3s
* If new podcasts / languages are added, optimize the UX to handle them
